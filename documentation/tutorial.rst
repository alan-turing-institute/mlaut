MLAUT Large Scale ML Benchmarking Study
---------------------------------------

We used ``mlaut`` to perform a large scale benchmarking study for a number of machine learning models. In doing so we recreated and expanded a previous paper (:cite:`fernandez-delgado_we_2014`).

The code for our study can be downloaded from the following link :download:`mlaut_study <../examples/mlaut_study.zip>` and can also be used as an advanced tutorial and reference for using ``mlaut``. Please note that the code works with mlaut **version 0.1.14**  which can be installed via::

    pip install mlaut==0.1.14
